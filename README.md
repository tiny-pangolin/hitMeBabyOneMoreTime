This C++ utility for calculating case depth of steel parts based on 4 samples.
I made this to assist me in calculating case depth in case I didn't feel like doing math that day. 
The source.cpp will work on microsoft windows and the linux.cpp will work on linux machines. 
I used g++ for the complier on Linux and the microsoft compiler on windows. 
I will also include a spreadsheet that does the same thing as well as finds the average corehardness
